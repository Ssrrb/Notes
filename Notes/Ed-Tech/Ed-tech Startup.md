Edtech software for private and public schools, education in Paraguay is the worst in the Region, only Venezuela and other developing countries are behind, so thats the other company I would like to build kids nowadays have access to mobile and laptops, but lack the software and programs to learn specially since we are a bilingual country Guarani software is very limited, thats the other company I would like to build Edtech software to solve Paraguay educational problems. The biggest problems lies in the public education where they cant make a student repeat courses so they lack foundational knowledge for future courses. The organizations and didactic resources are not structured, nor made to be followed in a progressive way like duolingo or videogames. Guarani integration is also very limited, I think thats a big differentiator building a complete roadmap to learn how to speak Spanish from Guarani and learning Guarani from spanish, I made some research and there are no competitors in the field like the one I'm presenting.
